# Reinforcement Learning: Deep Q-Learning for Games

Reinforcement Learning via Deep Q-Learning. Built using PyTorch and PyGame, an agent learns to play a simple game

### Description

### Running

This project requires `Python 3.11.6`, since PyTorch on Windows only supports `Python 3.8-3.11`.

1. Download and install `Python 3.11.6` from the [official site](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies `PyGame, PyTorch, etc`
3. Run `python agent.py` and the agent will begin training
4. Agent learns to complete the game after 40-60 attempts and learns the optimal path after 150-200 attempts
